Git Hub Authentication 

To keep the account secure, we must authenticate before we can access certain resources on GitHub. When you authenticate to GitHub, you supply or confirm credentials that are unique to the user to prove that you are exactly who you declare to be.

Each way of accessing GitHub supports different modes of authentication.

•	Username and password with two-factor authentication

•	Personal access token

•	SSH key
